      <h2>President: Naveed Tavakol</h2>
<h3>Email: dnt5ed@virginia.edu</h3>
<p>Naveed is a fourth year biomedical engineering major from Vienna, Virginia, hoping to pursue an M.D./Ph.D. for a career in academia. As Engineering Student Council President, he organizes the executive board, directors, and representatives and helps shape the goals and initiatives of the council as a whole. He also serves as the formal contact between the School of Engineering and University administration, as well as between community organizations and alumni. This year, Naveed hopes to (1) increase collaboration between ESC and various engineering CIOs, (2) build a cohesive network of ESC members, both past and present, and (3) continue to engage students and faculty outside of the classroom. Outside ESC, Naveed is involved in the Biomedical Engineering Society, the Class of 2017 Trustees, and undergraduate research.</p>

<h2>Vice President: Frances Morales</h2>

<p>Frances Morales is a third year biomedical engineer on the pre-med track, with high hopes of attending medical school after graduation. She is originally from Stafford, Virginia. Traditionally, the vice president coordinates our annual Fall Engineering Expo and the Engineer’s Week Celebration, among other events. This year she hopes to create a strong sense of unity between ESC and other organizations because when there is teamwork and collaboration, amazing things can be achieved. In her free time, she loves to watch movies, eat out with friends, and volunteer at the UVa hospital—in addition to her enthusiasm for helping lead ESC this upcoming year!</p>

<h2>Treasurer: Alex Lord</h2>
